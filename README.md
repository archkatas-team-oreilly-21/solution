## Problem analysis

### Existing system overview



### Requirements interpretation

Things have not been good with the Sysops Squad lately. The current trouble ticket system is a large monolithic application that was developed many years
ago. Customers are complaining that consultants are never showing up due to lost tickets, and often times the wrong consultant shows up to fix something
they know nothing about. Customers and call-center staff have been complaining that the system is not always available for web-based or call-based problem
ticket entry. Change is difficult and risky in this large monolith - whenever a change is made, it takes too long and something else usually breaks. Due to
reliability issues, the monolithic system frequently “freezes up” or crashes - they think it’s mostly due a spike in usage and the number of customers using the
system. If something isn’t done soon, Penultimate Electronics will be forced to abandon this very lucrative business line and fire all of the experts (including
you, the architect).
